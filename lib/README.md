### Note for Users
> [!NOTE] 
> 
> For best practices and ease of use, we recommend utilizing a CMake project setup. This approach ensures that end-users can build the project independently without needing to manually handle library dependencies. If opting for a different setup, ensure to provide a clear script for building the required libraries.
